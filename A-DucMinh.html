        <li><p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1">My name is Mai Duc Minh and my student number is s3681447 and I am honored to be elected as the project leader. I have studied Software Engineering for 6 semesters in RMIT. I usually play video games and listen to music in my free time. Sports are not counted as hobbies for me because I play sports for physical and mental training. I have some IoT experience with Arduino and household networking. I am interested in Python and have a long term plan which aims at machine learning in the medical aspect.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p></li>

      </ul>
      <p><img src="image/pointer 1.svg" alt="pointer1"><span>Both my personal and career life are indicated accurately in the Myers-Briggs test that I am very goal-oriented. “Practice makes perfect”</span> - My strategy is to set a high goal at first, make a concrete plan and push myself hard enough to follow little by little every day. However, the test also discovered a long-standing difficulty of mine, in which my work style would cause a lot of problems to people who are sensitive to criticism since I accidentally react strongly to the work to obtain best results. I am quite a curious person to every phenomenal thing around me so it is unsurprising that the Learning Style Test determines me as a visionary learner. To come up with a clear and detailed teamwork plan, I usually sketch my ideas on paper and make arrangements so that all the thoughts are logged to make sure I do not forget anything. The Big Five Personality test serves as a confirmation of the accuracy of both tests above and comprehensively reflects my personal character, working style so that other teammates can understand and coop better. I am willing to learn from others (decent Openness score), I am less affected to external factors (highest Conscientiousness score), I am very disciplined (lowest Extraversion score) but I am not a good communicator and easily prone to overwhelmed when the plan is off-tracked (high Neuroticism score).
      <br/><br/>
      As a team member, I can be a responsible person that always try to complete the task with best effort as well as contributing to comment for improvements. Moreover, with my experience, I can evaluate myself as an omni-purpose member than can take over most of the task in the team. As a team leader, I would implement the Waterfall model into teamwork and require other members to take high participation to discuss and come up with a detailed plan for me. The progress of the tasks is also logged clearly for me to adjust the plan in the future.<img src="image/pointer.svg" alt="pointer"></p>
